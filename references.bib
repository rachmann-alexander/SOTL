abstract = {Attendance has shown to have a positive effect on student performance in numerous disciplines. However, very few studies have focused on how attendance influences the learning of programming in the U.S. higher education system. This paper examines the relationship between attendance and student performance in introductory programming courses. Data were collected from 103 students from nine class sessions of introductory programming classes taught at University X by two instructors in the department of Computer Science in the first and second semesters during the 2014/2015 academic year. The statistical analyses showed a significant positive correlation between attendance and student programming performance beyond other factors. Thus, encouraging attendance is recommended to educators as a pedagogical strategy.},

abstract = {This paper describes an exploratory study to identify which environmental and student factors best predict intention to persist in the computer science major. The findings can be used to make decisions about initiatives for increasing retention. Eight indices of student characteristics and perceptions were developed using the research-based Student Experience of the Major Survey: student-student interaction; student-faculty interaction; collaborative learning opportunities; pace/workload/prior experience with programming; teaching assistants; classroom climate/pedagogy; meaningful assignments; and racism/sexism. A linear regression revealed that student-student interaction was the most powerful predictor of students' intention to persist in the major beyond the introductory course. Other factors predicting intention to persist were pace/workload/prior experience and male gender. The findings suggest that computer science departments interested in increasing retention of students set structured expectations for student-student interaction in ways that integrate peer involvement as a mainstream activity rather than making it optional or extracurricular. They also suggest departments find ways to manage programming experience gaps in CS1.},

Medical students of3rd year and above representing different medical colleges were asked to fillout a questionnaire to assess the different reasons why medical students tendto absent themselves from lectures, their views regarding content and qualityof lectures. Students having attendance of 50% or more were included in thestudy.Results: A total of 509 student responded to the survey. Two hundred andeighty two students (having &amp;amp;gt;50% attendance in the last semester) were includedin the study. Mean age was 21.14 ± 1.9 years. There were 110 (39%)males and 172 (61%) females. The two most common reasons for not attendingthe lectures were; timing of the lectures not adjusted according tothe students schedule (n=180; 63.8%) and the students preferred self/groupstudy over lectures (n=198; 70.2%). On the other hand majority of the students(n=173; 61.3%) were also of the opinion that it is difficult and complexto learn without lectures.Conclusion: There are various reasons for absenteeism from lectures includingtiming of the lectures and preference for self study. These need to be rectifiedin order to strengthen the learning process in medical undergraduates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, number={2}, journal={Journal of Postgraduate Medical Institute}, author={Hafeez, Kamran and Khan, Mohammad Laiq-uz-Zaman and Jawaid, Masood and Haroon, Saroona}, year={2014}, month={Apr.} }
